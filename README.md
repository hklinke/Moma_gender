gender gap in MoMa exhibitions

This is based on the MoMa's collection data that you can find at https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection

It shows that the gender gap of the participants in exhibitions between 1929 and 1989 never narrowed. See: https://twitter.com/HxxxKxxx/status/907872386237779968
